# Roadmap: From Data Enthusiast to Data Engineer & Architect

Welcome to the **professional roadmap** in the `datum` portfolio. This living document outlines a structured path from data-curious developer to **certified, hirable data engineer and (ultimately) data architect**. The roadmap combines self-study, hands-on projects, certification prep, and portfolio-building, organized for clarity, skill progression, and maximum industry relevance.

## Vision & Objectives

- **End Goal:** Transition into a data engineering role, progress toward data architect, and build a portfolio that proves your readiness for industry jobs.
- **Key Outcomes:**
  - Master core data engineering skills: databases, pipelines, analytics, visualization, cloud, and architecture essentials.
  - Earn recognized, practical certifications that signal job readiness.
  - Develop a robust, modular, public portfolio of real projects using Python and Rust.
  - Build professional habits for self-directed growth, accountability, and continuous learning.

## Learning Phases

### 1. Fundamentals & SQL Mastery _(Weeks 1–6)_

- **Databases:** Deepen SQL (PostgreSQL focus, some MongoDB).
- **Core Skills:** Data modeling, querying, normalization, schema design.
- **Portfolio:** Populate `python/sqlmastery/` with progressive exercises and project-style challenges.
- **Milestone:** Achieve fluency in reading/writing complex SQL; document learning with worked examples.

### 2. Programming for Data Engineering _(Weeks 7–12)_

- **Python Track:** Pipelines with Pandas, ETL logic, basic Airflow/Prefect exploration.
- **Rust Track:** Begin Rust ETL/analytics with Polars, Arrow, sqlx; learn Rust project structure in a workspace.
- **Version Control:** Solidify git/jj fluency, apply collaborative and professional workflows.

### 3. Data Engineering in Practice _(Weeks 13–20)_

- **Projects:** Real data pipelines—data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, reporting.
- **DevOps / Portability:** Experiment with containerization (Docker), deployment scripts, basic cloud intro (AWS/GCP free tiers if accessible).
- **Portfolio Expansion:** Add projects such as NBA stats, weather data, or open datasets—each in a distinct subfolder.
- **Testing & Quality:** Implement automated tests, linting, and documentation in both stacks.

### 4. Advanced Topics & Job Readiness _(Weeks 21–30+)_

- **Big Data:** Spark basics, distributed pipelines (PySpark or Rust/Polars clustering).
- **Architectural Patterns:** Learn data warehousing, modern data stack (DBT, ELT), basics of orchestration.
- **System Design:** Study architectural decision-making using sample interview challenges.
- **Interview Prep:** Practice take-home tasks, code reviews, resume, and LinkedIn polish.
- **Capstone:** Build a showcase project in `python/` or `rust/` that demonstrates end-to-end workflow and architectural chops.

## Certification & Industry Readiness

| Area                 | Recommended Certification(s)                            | Notes                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SQL/Data Engineering | Google Data Engineer, Datacamp SQL, or Microsoft DP-900 | Free/affordable; check for scholarship options |
| Python/Pandas        | Datacamp, Coursera, or edX microcredentials             | Focus on hands-on, practical courses           |
| Cloud/Data Platforms | AWS Cloud Practitioner, GCP Associate                   | Start with free tiers/cert prep materials      |
| Optional: Rust       | No common cert yet—use open-source/project endorsement  | Build credibility with strong projects         |

- Research scholarship/free voucher opportunities frequently.
- Publicly post certificates and course completions in your profile/README.

## Portfolio & Projects

- **Purpose:** Each project demonstrates a discrete skill, tool, or concept. Start small and grow.
- **Structure:**
  - `shared/` — Datasets (public), utilities for repeatable use.
  - `python/` — Monorepo: `sqlmastery/`, analytics projects, pipeline demos.
  - `rust/` — Cargo workspace: ETL/analytics projects leveraging Rust-native stack.
- **Documentation:** Every project has a README stating objectives, approach, results, and what you learned—link back to main roadmap index.
- **Prioritize:**
  - Data pipeline construction (build, test, run)
  - Real analytics: e.g. NBA stats, weather, open government data
  - Notebook-driven reports/analysis (where appropriate)

---

## Accountability & Growth Habits

- **Weekly Check-ins:** Log progress and blockers, adjust timelines as needed.
- **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub’s issues/boards for task management and retrospectives.
- **Reflection:** Maintain a “learning journal” in this repo (e.g. `LEARNING.md`), recording what worked, what didn’t, and next goals.
- **Networking:** Share key wins and finished projects on LinkedIn, blogs, or community forums.

---

## Resources & References

- **Databases:** Mode SQL SQL tutorials, Postgres official docs, MongoDB University (free).
- **Python:** Real Python, pandas documentation, DataCamp.
- **Rust:** Official Rust book, Polars docs, community forums.
- **Certifications:** Google Cloud, Microsoft Learn, AWS Training, Coursera/edX (audit for free).
- **Interview Prep:** LeetCode SQL, system design blogs, real-world project galleries.

## Progress Tracking

Keep a dated log of your achievements here. Example:

| Date       | Phase/Project      | Achievement/Notes                    |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| YYYY-MM-DD | SQLMastery started | Set up project, solved 5 exercises   |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Project-2          | Pipeline ingests and transforms data |
| …          | …                  | …                                    |

Update regularly as you grow. Celebrate milestones—every skill matters!
